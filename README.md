# 🚀 AI Interview Simulator

> Practice Smarter. Interview Better.

AI Interview Simulator is a full-stack web application that simulates structured technical interviews using Artificial Intelligence.  
It generates role-based interview questions, evaluates answers in real time, and provides performance analytics.

Built during a hackathon with scalability in mind.

## 🧠 Problem

Many students fail technical interviews not because they lack knowledge, but because they lack:

- Real interview simulation  
- Structured feedback  
- Performance tracking  
- Confidence under pressure  

Traditional preparation methods are passive and ineffective.

AI Interview Simulator creates a realistic mock interview environment that:

- Generates 5 role-based technical questions  
- Evaluates answers using AI  
- Scores responses objectively  
- Provides strengths & improvement feedback  
- Displays final performance analytics
